Online education in the current situation has become a place of interest due to COVID 19 pandemic, The COVID-19 has resulted in schools shut across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion people are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. In this project we will implement a platform that combine both graduate and undergraduate students mostly for people who have a full schedule, and they cannot take courses in their work time, most of the similar websites are foreign, and the local ones only focuses on students not including graduates. In our project time is not an issue people will be able to increase their knowledge and information any time they want in any topic of their choosing such as basic math, IT &amp; Software, Design, business, language courses etc. Even more for teachers who wants to lecture a course online paid or free hopefully our project will help them do that also they can test their students understanding by conducting exams. Students can look up courses easily and see the top-rated courses on the home page also rate their subscribed courses to help other people. Students can access the course content without the need of internet they can basically download the required content and start learning.
